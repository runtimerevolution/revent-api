## Guidelines

### Branch Naming

Everytime we need to work on a new feature, bug or any type of task, we need to create a new branch.
Below will be a step by step guide on how we can create and start to work on a task:

The nomenclature for someone named "JoÃ£o Gomes" that need to fix a new "Bug" on a ticket with the ID "1234" and name "Update salary" goes like this:

`jg/bug/1234/Update-salary`

- jg - First and last name initials

- bug - Type of task to be performed

- 1234 - Ticket ID

- Update-salary - Ticket name

## Who do I talk to?

- You can always talk to your Team Leader or the repo owner for any question regarding this project.

## Setup Time

### Prerequisites

#### Install the correct Python version

1 - Install pyenv

```bash
brew install pyenv

echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

2 - Install the project's python version

This command will install the python version that is set in `.python-version`

```bash
pyenv install
```

3 - Verify that you're using the correct Python version

```bash
pyenv versions
```

#### Install Poetry

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Poetry Basics

- Now let's start by always activating a virtual environment to work on when we open the project:
  If you need to get out of this virtual environment just type **deactivate**

  ```bash
  poetry shell
  ```

- You should have a file called pyproject.toml, with it we can install everything that is needed!
  Just a second, make sure you are on your project folder! Let's go and install everything now:

  ```bash
  poetry install --no-root
  ```

  This is great! Right now, we have our packages installed!

- One last thing! We still need to tell our IDE to use this new interpreter!
  Alright, and how do we do this? Its easy, really. (This next steps will be for vscode)

      1. Copy the path from the command below:

          ```bash
          poetry env info --path
          ```

      2. In your vscode, go to settings and search for python interpreter

      3. Now select to use a specific path and use the one you just copied
      Press Enter and you'r done! Now vscode will use this one.

### Makefile

A lot of commands are available in the Makefile to simplify the setup and day to day tasks.
To get some info regarding these commands you can run:

```bash
make
# OR
make help
```

### Running the Project

To start the docker containers run

```bash
make up
```

After that run the migrations if needed

```bash
make migrate
```

Finally run the app

```bash
make run
```

Perfect! You are now running the project locally and you can now start coding!

## Running Tests

To run the tests, inside your working environment run:

```bash
make test
```

To add tests remember that the python automatic discover only works properly for files named "test\_\*.py".

## Dummy data

To generate dummy data ensure that the localstack is running and all the migrations are aplied and use the command:

```bash
make populate
```

### TLDR;

Check what's available in the Makefile.

Python 3.10.13 environment must exist and be active. Use poetry shell for this.

```bash
  make up
  make migrate
  make run
```

### Setting up localstack s3 to fake Aws

After you have installed Docker we will need to install AWS CLI. Even though we are simulating
the AWS, we will require this to comunicate with the docker containers:

1. Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
2. After it is installed we will need to supply credentials, even if the
   credentials are dummies. Localstack requires this details to be present. For that run the command:
   ```bash
     aws configure
   ```

In order to create a bucket you can just run the tests to verify everithing is working properly and it will be created automatically.

### Nice to Have

#### Direnv

Looking for a way to start your venv by doing... nothing!?
I know i know, it looks almost like magic. Let me tell you about direnv

- direnv will load and unload a virtual environment everytime we enter or leave the folder
  How do we install it? Let's take a look.

  1. Let's start by creating an empty file called .envrc

  2. Now we can download direnv [here](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html)

  3. Hook it into your shell like [this](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)

  4. Alright and finally add the following to your .envrc:

     `layout pyenv 3.10.4`
     Note: Everytime you edit your .envrc file direnv will ask you to give permission by typing:
     `direnv allow`

  5. **_Important: Now that you changed for direnv replicate the python interpreter change that you did in poetry section_**

  6. Reload your shell and you'r set! Now you can leave your folder and come back inside to test if .direnv will show up (thats your new venv).
     Everytime you go into or out of your project folder .direnv will activate or deactivate!

## Terraform

This is the easiest way to install Terraform in ARM based CPUs. If you install Terraform directly with an ARM based CPU you might get some errors saying that some providers are not available for ARM. For Intel you can just install Terraform directly.

### Install TFenv

```bash
brew install tfenv
```

### Install Terraform

This command will install the Terraform version that is set in `.terraform-version`

```bash
tfenv use # If Intel CPU
TFENV_ARCH=amd64 tfenv use # If ARM CPU
```

You can check your architecture by running the following command:

```bash
uname -a
# output example for ARM CPU
> Darwin <USERNAME> 23.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 23.6.0: <DATE>; root:xnu-10063.141.2~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T8103 arm64
```
